But I mine a pick
I mine a creeper
What the pickaxe mine I mine' here?
I minen't belong here
I minen't care if it hurts
I mine na mine iron
I mine a perfect axe
I mine a perfect creeper
I mine you to notice
When I mine not around
So fuckin' special
I mine I was special
But I mine a night
I mine a axe
What the iron mine I mine' here?
I minen't belong creepers
