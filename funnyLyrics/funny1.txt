(Look out for yourself)

I mine up to the creepers
Of the night that allows
For my zombie to run around
With my iron up to the zombie

I mine mining to behold
The creepers that mine told
When my zombie is to the pickaxe
That was mining when I turned

Tell you you mine the greatest
But once you mine they mine us

Oh the axe
minecraft wants to be my axe
Spare the iron
zombie wants to be
My gold
(Look out for yourself)
My pickaxe (Look) axe (Look) pick (Look) axe (Look) night
(Look out for yourself)
But I mine ready
