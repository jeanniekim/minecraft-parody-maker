(Look out for yourself)

I wake up to the sounds
Of the iron ore,3 that allows
For my mining,2 to run around
With my zombie,1 up to the zombie,1

I'm searching to behold
The stories that are told
When my axes,2 is to the mining,2
That was smiling when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh the gold,1
Diamond,2 wants to be my mines,1
Spare the ore,1
Pickaxe,1 wants to be
My creepers,1
(Look out for yourself)
My iron,2 (Look) axes,2 (Look) mines,1 (Look) zombie,1 (Look) mines,1
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm night,1
