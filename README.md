### What is a Minecraft Parody?
Minecraft parodies are parodies of popular songs whose lyrics are edited (often minimally) to be related to the game Minecraft.
There are countless Minecraft parodies being uploaded every day, and it can almost be guaranteed that for every "popular" song, there exists at least one Minecraft parody of it.
These parodies often involve a vocal performance from a young or young-sounding person, true to the Minecraft demographic. Voice cracks are considered part of the genre.
