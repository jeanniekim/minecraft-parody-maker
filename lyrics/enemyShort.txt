(Look out for yourself)

I wake up to the sounds
Of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around
With my ear up to the ground

I'm searching to behold
The stories that are told
When my back is to the world
That was smiling when I turned

But once you turn they hate us

Oh the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy-y-y-y-y
(Look out for yourself)
My enemy(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready
